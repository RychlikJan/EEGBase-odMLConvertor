Data package structure:

The tool is runable with one mandatory argument and one optional argument.

The mandatory argument is path to the data package, where are "metadata" and folder "Data" and convert them to NIX/odML. 
If the path enter into folder, where are no metadata, check all folders inside.
 If the folders inside id a data package, try to convert the value 
of this folder. By this way is possible to concert more than one data package. The path has to be
 write without last separator.
